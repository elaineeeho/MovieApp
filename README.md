### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the biggest challenges I encountered while building the app was resizing the movie posters so that it was stretched. I learned to resize the images so that the original poster view is shown in the app.
Another challenge I faced was adding the AlamofireImage package. My Xcode was running on an older version so I was not able to locate the tab to add a package to my Xcode project.
